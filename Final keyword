**final keyword ---- constant 
1. data members
2.methods
3.class

need to initialize final at time of declaration

final int NUMBER = 100;// data member must be in uppercase

final method cannot be overridden  

final class cannot be inherited  by another class , but final class can inherite another class
final class can be a child class to a parent  class but.canot be a parent class to child

final class FinalClass {
parent
}
class SubClass(child) extends FinalClass(parent) { // This will cause a compilation error
} 

A method declared as final cannot be overridden in a subclass.



**abstract 
1.method

2.class

when a method in a class has abstract then need to make that class abstract...but if class is abstract then no need to dec abstract in method
 
 referens can be created 
 
  instance of class / obj cannot be created in abstract.....to use abstract class inheritance  is must  
  
   *Abstract methods must be implemented by any non-abstract subclass.
  
  concrete -- which is not abstract
